\subsection{P-base}\label{pbase_chapter}

In order to build BiCMOS on the same substrate, a nested P-well within the N-well (now it's twin well) is required for building the bijunction transistors.

The cross section as well as the top view of the targeted geometry are shown in \autoref{pbase_target}

The P-base will serve us as an island of higher P-doped substrate within the slightly N-well basis substrate, which will result in a isolated area by forming PN junction versus PN junction.

The dopant dose will be $1.93\times10^{12}cm^{-2}$ at 40 keV, as calculated in the documentation of the process design leading to these steps\footnote{\url{https://github.com/leviathanch/libresiliconprocess/raw/master/process_design/process_design.pdf}}.

The P-base can very well cover the N-well area since the expansion mostly is vertical, but it should be kept in mind, that there is also a lateral diffusion when placing contacts also on N-well around the P-base.

The layout is being automatically generated for GDS2 based on cifoutput rules, so you just have to draw your P-base.

After the implantation we perform a drive-in in inert atmosphere at $1050\degreesC$ for one hour.
