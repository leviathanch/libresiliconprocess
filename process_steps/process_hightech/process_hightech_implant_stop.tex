\subsection{Implant stop}\label{implant_stop_chapter}

In order to have a control on where the junction dopants from \autoref{nimplant_chapter} and \autoref{pimplant_chapter} are being placed in the active area we use a layer of oxide as a hard mask.
This is important for controlling the Zener diode break down voltage.

Because of the energy, with which the dopants are implanted (range straggle), a thickness of 200nm is being chosen for the LTO deposition, in order to make sure, that all the dopants are being absorbed
within the LTO.
